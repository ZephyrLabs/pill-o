the backend management service and a simulative environment that replicates the behaviour of our medical dispensery system.

The tech stack behind this application:
* **C/C++** For the programming language
* **LVGL & SDL** as the Graphics library and the platform graphics driver.
* **OpenCV2** for the QR Code Processing and Decoding.
* **Curl** to facilitate communication with the backend
* **nlohmann's JSON** library to parse and processing json responses
